    description: Use this service to securely store you solution's tables. This service collaborates with many other services as either a destination for data or a source of data. A Kafka Connector Service for instance, can only be deployed if attached to an IRIS database. On the other hand, a Live Aggregation Service needs an IRIS database as the source of the live data to aggregate.
